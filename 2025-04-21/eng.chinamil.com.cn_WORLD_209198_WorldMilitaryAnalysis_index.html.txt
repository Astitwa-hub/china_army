Whose security do US-ROK joint military exercises protect?

France-US-Japan joint exercise in Philippine Sea stirs up regional situation

European defense autonomy remains an arduous task
It is evident that while Macron's call for strengthening European defense autonomy is highly relevant, Europe must confront multiple challenges both internally and externally.
