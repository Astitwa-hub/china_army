European defense autonomy remains an arduous task
It is evident that while Macron's call for strengthening European defense autonomy is highly relevant, Europe must confront multiple challenges both internally and externally.

Amid sluggish economic growth in Europe and the prolonged regional conflicts, the insistence of NATO on increasing defense spending and strengthening geopolitical confrontation will not bring true peace to Europe.

According to Spacenews, during the Spacepower Conference on December 10, Anthony Mastalir, commander of US Space Forces Indo-Pacific, stated that China's advanced satellite capabilities are "a pressing concern" for both the US and Japan, prompting the two countries to strengthen their partnership and prepare to counteract these "threats."

As Russia-Ukraine conflict escalates, when will peace talk come?
In the future, the direction of the Ukrainian crisis will mainly depend on whether Russia and the US can reach a compromise on key conditions. If Russia does not accept the US proposal, Trump may increase aid to Ukraine and the conflict will continue. Even if both parties agree to sit down and negotiate, it will be a long process before reaching an agreement.
