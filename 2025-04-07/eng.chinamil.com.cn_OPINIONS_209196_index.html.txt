Australia's paranoia over China's research vessel unfounded, it doesn't have to be this way
Over the past two days, Australia has been paranoid about a Chinese research vessel that appeared off the coast of South Australia. In Australian media's portrayal, what was originally a harmless research ship has, for no clear reason, been transformed into a "spy ship."

When Taiwan's Lai plays with fire, don't blame the smoke
Faced with these provocations, the mainland must take resolute countermeasures. Failure to respond would constitute a glaring appeasement of secession, risking the legitimacy of the Chinese government and the support of its people, with peace across the Taiwan Strait hanging in the balance.

"Taiwan independence" means nothing but war
Nothing shall hold back the trend of history. The pursuit of "Taiwan independence" is a dead end. We will not tolerate or condone any conspiracy aiming at splitting Taiwan from China. The Chinese PLA has the guts, determination, resolve, and very importantly the ability to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and dignity.

Washington's overreaction to PLA drills serves as a telling sign of its duplicity
Despite Beijing unequivocally stating the military exercises it launched this week near the Taiwan island "are a serious warning and an act of containment against 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces, and a legitimate and necessary move to defend national sovereignty and uphold national unity", some still wrongly insist they are a test of the United States' and its allies' resolve to "defend" Taiwan.

Combat drill a big warning to 'Taiwan independence' secessionists
The Chinese mainland has always drawn a clear line between "Taiwan independence" forces and the broader public in Taiwan. This operation is only aimed at Lai's radical agenda, not ordinary residents.

PLA's joint exercises demonstrate capability to thwart any push for 'Taiwan independence'
The military's message was stern and explicit, with Shi Yi, spokesperson for the theater command, highlighting the comprehensive scope of the exercises, which involve the coordinated operations of the army, navy, air and rocket forces converging on the island from various directions.

US security alliances in Asia nothing but hollow promises in a losing game
This is the reality of the US' alliances in Asia: they are not partnerships of equals, but instruments of US dominance. Japan, like Europe, is expected to follow Washington's lead on security â hosting US bases, aligning with NATO's expansion into Asia, and escalating military spending â while simultaneously enduring punitive trade policies.

Distorted view on Japan's aggression during WWII needs to be corrected
Increasingly, some in the West, driven by short-sighted political interests, are willing to distort, downplay, or even whitewash the history of aggression. In particular, they have repeatedly offered selective interpretations of WWII history and weaponized it to pursue "realpolitik" interests.

Can France carry the ball in Europe's rearmament?
If France can effectively resolve its financial difficulties, properly manage domestic and international differences, efficiently integrate Europe's defense industrial resources, and establish a joint command system, it could still play a more pivotal leadership role in advancing European defense autonomy.

Greenland should make 'rogue state' go away
Despite Vance's scaremongering, the US' true motives were laid bare by National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who dispensed with Vance's pretenses and admitted: "This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries."

For separatist agenda, Lai Ching-te resorts to "green authoritarianism"
Taiwan's democracy and rule of law are backsliding while the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities led by Lai Ching-te are suppressing political opponents and dissenting voices and restricting freedom of expression.

Lai Ching-te's regression on cross-Strait exchanges doomed to fail
However intense the DPP-imposed restrictions are, they can not block the genuine goodwill and close ties between people on both sides of the Strait. Lai's desperate attempts to shut the doors of exchanges and cooperation are doomed to a shameful failure.
