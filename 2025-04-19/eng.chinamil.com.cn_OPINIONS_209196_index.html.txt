Uncertainty looms over US-Iran nuclear talks
The path of military threats and maximum pressure offers no resolution. Genuine political will and engagement in dialogue and negotiation are the proper course. However, the demand of the US for denuclearization directly contradicts Iran's insistence on sovereignty.

Trillion-dollar US defense budget in sight?
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced on April 7 local time plans to propose a defense budget totaling $1 trillion. This figure represents a significant increase from the $895 billion in defense funding approved by the US Congress for fiscal year 2025, setting a new historical record.

Malicious calculations behind US military strategy toward China
Perhaps considering the internal political struggles in the ROK and the subsequent direction, Hegseth bypassed the ROK, an important ally in the region, during his trip to the Asia-Pacific region. However, Japan and the Philippines are both key countries on the first island chain of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy to contain China.

Japan's intention to reshape its underwater combat layout warrants vigilance
Japan's advancement in UUV development and deployment is a prominent example of its shift in defense strategy from "exclusively defense-oriented policy" to "proactive offense." Japan's attempts to reshape its underwater combat posture and develop asymmetric underwater warfare methods pose new risks to regional security, thus warranting vigilance from neighboring countries.

US-NATO trust rift deepens
The two-day NATO foreign ministers' meeting concluded in Brussels on April 4. During the meeting, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio once again urged NATO member states to increase their defense spending.

The Asia-Pacific region doesn't welcome NATO's attempt to peddle fear
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is set to begin his official visit to Japan on Tuesday - his first trip to the Asia-Pacific region since assuming the post. Both NATO's official statements and those from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs have already revealed the strategic and political calculations behind this visit.

US shouldn't use South China Sea to relive its old dream of maritime hegemony
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently visited the Philippines and spoke at length about the so-called "military threat in the South China Sea." The Declaration on Maritime Security and Prosperity, issued at the G7 foreign ministers' meeting in mid-March, reiterated outdated rhetoric, unfairly and groundlessly criticizing China under the pretext of "protecting freedom of navigation."

Why are the U.S. and Iran talking in Oman and what's at stake?
While U.S. President Donald Trump describes the engagement as a "direct" dialogue, Iran insists it will be an "indirect" negotiation, mediated through third parties. Here's what we know and what remains uncertain.

Ukraine crisis lucrative business for U.S. military-industrial complex
The architects of escalation can never masquerade as architects of peace. Behind the polished rhetoric of "security" and "solidarity," the truth is laid bare: The U.S. war machine's loyalties lie not with diplomacy or humanity, but with the relentless churn of profit.

Why US Defense Secretary chooses the Philippines as his Asia-Pacific tour's first stop?
These actions by the US have sent the wrong signals to the Philippines and would potentially embolden the country to take more reckless actions in the South China Sea. This could escalate tensions in the South China Sea and further complicate the situation.

Global nuclear proliferation risks increase
âAnalysts point out that as the US shifts toward "new isolationism," some countries may leverage US power to deploy nuclear weapons on their territory and gradually develop independent nuclear capabilities. Once a country crosses the line, it could trigger a "broken windows effect" and a chain reaction.

Hypocrisy of some on Taiwan question laid bare
If the G7 members and the EU are genuinely interested in the preservation of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, they should put an end to their provocative words and deeds, especially their aggressive military posturing that necessitates the PLA showing its capability to respond.

US hegemony exposed in full in its persistence in seizing Greenland
The so-called "economic security needs" of the US cannot justify its pursuit of hegemonic diplomacy. Its attempt to seize Greenland through a power-politics approach will only push the security situation in the Arctic to the brink of danger and bring greater uncertainty to global peace and stability.

Rubio's NATO visit exposes mounting tensions, eroding trust in transatlantic ties
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio attended his first NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, where he reaffirmed Washington's position that Europe should take more responsibility for defending the alliance.

Australia's paranoia over China's research vessel unfounded, it doesn't have to be this way
Over the past two days, Australia has been paranoid about a Chinese research vessel that appeared off the coast of South Australia. In Australian media's portrayal, what was originally a harmless research ship has, for no clear reason, been transformed into a "spy ship."
