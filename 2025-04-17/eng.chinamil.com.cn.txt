Trillion-dollar US defense budget in sight?
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced on April 7 local time plans to propose a defense budget totaling $1 trillion. This figure represents a significant increase from the $895 billion in defense funding approved by the US Congress for fiscal year 2025, setting a new historical record.
Malicious calculations behind US military strategy toward China
Perhaps considering the internal political struggles in the ROK and the subsequent direction, Hegseth bypassed the ROK, an important ally in the region, during his trip to the Asia-Pacific region. However, Japan and the Philippines are both key countries on the first island chain of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy to contain China.
