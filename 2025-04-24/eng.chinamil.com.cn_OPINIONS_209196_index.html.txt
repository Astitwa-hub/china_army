US plans to deploy new missiles in the Philippines to complete its "Missile Chain"

Uncertainty looms over US-Iran nuclear talks
The path of military threats and maximum pressure offers no resolution. Genuine political will and engagement in dialogue and negotiation are the proper course. However, the demand of the US for denuclearization directly contradicts Iran's insistence on sovereignty.

Trillion-dollar US defense budget in sight?
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced on April 7 local time plans to propose a defense budget totaling $1 trillion.

Malicious calculations behind US military strategy toward China
Perhaps considering the internal political struggles in the ROK and the subsequent direction, Hegseth bypassed the ROK, an important ally in the region, during his trip to the Asia-Pacific region. However, Japan and the Philippines are both key countries on the first island chain of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy to contain China.

Japan's intention to reshape its underwater combat layout warrants vigilance
Japan's advancement in UUV development and deployment is a prominent example of its shift in defense strategy from "exclusively defense-oriented policy" to "proactive offense." Japan's attempts to reshape its underwater combat posture and develop asymmetric underwater warfare methods pose new risks to regional security, thus warranting vigilance from neighboring countries.

US shouldn't use South China Sea to relive its old dream of maritime hegemony
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently visited the Philippines and spoke at length about the so-called "military threat in the South China Sea." The Declaration on Maritime Security and Prosperity, issued at the G7 foreign ministers' meeting in mid-March, reiterated outdated rhetoric, unfairly and groundlessly criticizing China under the pretext of "protecting freedom of navigation."

Why are the U.S. and Iran talking in Oman and what's at stake?
While U.S. President Donald Trump describes the engagement as a "direct" dialogue, Iran insists it will be an "indirect" negotiation, mediated through third parties. Here's what we know and what remains uncertain.

Ukraine crisis lucrative business for U.S. military-industrial complex
The architects of escalation can never masquerade as architects of peace. Behind the polished rhetoric of "security" and "solidarity," the truth is laid bare: The U.S. war machine's loyalties lie not with diplomacy or humanity, but with the relentless churn of profit.
