A telling example of the failing anti-China smear campaign

US seeks to pressure European allies by threatening NATO exit
NATO is a product of the Cold War and, logically, should have ended when the Cold War did. Although NATO wasn't dissolved, its relevance and necessity have declined significantly after the Cold War. While NATO has expanded geographically, its defense budgets, military capabilities, and internal cohesion have noticeably weakened.

G7 statement shows its ideological bias
In their meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, on Friday, the G7 foreign ministers released a joint statement, in which they again bad-mouthed China on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, South China issue, and the Taiwan question, as well as nuclear weapons.

Lai Ching-te's separatist bubble
Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te recently unveiled 17 strategies to counter so-called "threats" from the Chinese mainland facing the island. The latest move once again revealed the authoritarian nature behind his "Taiwan independence" attempts and his stance against cross-Strait communication, peace and democracy.

Due care and attention to all parties' concerns key to peace and stability in the Middle East
Upholding the principle of mutual respect is the only viable path to finding the greatest common ground that accommodates the legitimate concerns of all parties and enables the region to move on from the turmoil that has convulsed it for decades.

Dialogue only viable option to solve Iranian nuclear issue
In an increasingly complex and fragile international environment, relying on sanctions and military posturing is not only counterproductive but also dangerously short-sighted, promoting instability rather than fostering meaningful engagement.

Anti-Secession Law a strong, effective deterrent to "Taiwan independence"
It was a milestone event in mainland-Taiwan relations as the law embodies both the will of the state and the common interests of Chinese people across the Taiwan Strait, and codifies the fundamental policy to foil "Taiwan independence" and advance national reunification.

All secessionist tricks of Lai are doomed to failure
It is no coincidence that Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te gave a "pro-independence" speech on Thursday, one day before the 20th anniversary of the implementation of the Anti-Secession Law by Beijing. But Lai's extremely provocative speech will only have served to consolidate the mainland's resolve to realize national reunification.

Returning Chagos Islands to Mauritius has nothing to do with China
The UK is seeking to finalize a deal on handing sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a matter purely between the UK and Mauritius. However, some US and UK politicians have dragged China into the issue, claiming that returning the Chagos Islands would benefit China and potentially provide a foothold for Chinese military presence in the Indian Ocean.

U.S. dirty calculations behind Ukraine ceasefire plan
From a "firm ally" for Ukraine to a "neutral mediator" in peace talks, Washington has its selfish political calculations. It is not mediating for "peace" but to maximize its own interests in the conflict. Having reaped colossal profits from arms sales and energy sales to the EU, the U.S. is diverting its attention to mineral resources.

European defense integration has long way to go
It has long been a persistent goal for the EU to pursue autonomous defense. Despite its aspirations to develop an independent military force and achieve defense integration, tangible progress has remained elusive.

Whose security do US-ROK joint military exercises protect?
The recent bombing tragedy in Pocheon sounds yet another alarm for regional nations and their people. If certain parties insist on treating East Asia as a powder keg and civilians as bargaining chips, the next "misguided" bomb will ultimately obliterate their credibility and the trust of the people they claim to protect.
