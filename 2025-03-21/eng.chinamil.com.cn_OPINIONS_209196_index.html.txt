G7's ploy won't change the fact that Taiwan belongs to China
The Cairo Declaration, issued in December 1943, and the Potsdam Proclamation, announced in July 1945, clearly stipulated that Taiwan, which was illegally occupied by Japan, must be returned to China. In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, which settled once and for all the issue of China's representation in the UN, and it covered the whole country, including Taiwan.

A telling example of the failing anti-China smear campaign

US seeks to pressure European allies by threatening NATO exit
NATO is a product of the Cold War and, logically, should have ended when the Cold War did. Although NATO wasn't dissolved, its relevance and necessity have declined significantly after the Cold War. While NATO has expanded geographically, its defense budgets, military capabilities, and internal cohesion have noticeably weakened.

Lai Ching-te's separatist bubble

Due care and attention to all parties' concerns key to peace and stability in the Middle East

Dialogue only viable option to solve Iranian nuclear issue

Anti-Secession Law a strong, effective deterrent to "Taiwan independence"
It was a milestone event in mainland-Taiwan relations as the law embodies both the will of the state and the common interests of Chinese people across the Taiwan Strait, and codifies the fundamental policy to foil "Taiwan independence" and advance national reunification.

All secessionist tricks of Lai are doomed to failure
It is no coincidence that Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te gave a "pro-independence" speech on Thursday, one day before the 20th anniversary of the implementation of the Anti-Secession Law by Beijing. But Lai's extremely provocative speech will only have served to consolidate the mainland's resolve to realize national reunification.

Returning Chagos Islands to Mauritius has nothing to do with China
The UK is seeking to finalize a deal on handing sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a matter purely between the UK and Mauritius.

U.S. dirty calculations behind Ukraine ceasefire plan
From a "firm ally" for Ukraine to a "neutral mediator" in peace talks, Washington has its selfish political calculations. It is not mediating for "peace" but to maximize its own interests in the conflict. Having reaped colossal profits from arms sales and energy sales to the EU, the U.S. is diverting its attention to mineral resources.
