Israel's operations in Gaza must cease
History has shown that violence is not the answer to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Nuclear sharing: Shield or Illusion?
Looking back at history, whether it was Georgia in 2008, or now Ukraine and Europe, they have all become sacrifices for the US to pursue its own interests. Can the US promises of nuclear sharing and nuclear protection be trusted by Europe? Can other US security guarantees be trusted? And in the future, can US allies trust the US? These questions certainly raise significant doubts.

G7's ploy won't change the fact that Taiwan belongs to China
The Cairo Declaration, issued in December 1943, and the Potsdam Proclamation, announced in July 1945, clearly stipulated that Taiwan, which was illegally occupied by Japan, must be returned to China. In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, which settled once and for all the issue of China's representation in the UN, and it covered the whole country, including Taiwan.

US seeks to pressure European allies by threatening NATO exit
NATO is a product of the Cold War and, logically, should have ended when the Cold War did. Although NATO wasn't dissolved, its relevance and necessity have declined significantly after the Cold War. While NATO has expanded geographically, its defense budgets, military capabilities, and internal cohesion have noticeably weakened.

G7 statement shows its ideological bias
In their meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, on Friday, the G7 foreign ministers released a joint statement, in which they again bad-mouthed China on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, South China issue, and the Taiwan question, as well as nuclear weapons.

Due care and attention to all parties' concerns key to peace and stability in the Middle East
