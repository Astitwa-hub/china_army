Distorted view on Japan's aggression during WWII needs to be corrected

Can France carry the ball in Europe's rearmament?
If France can effectively resolve its financial difficulties, properly manage domestic and international differences, efficiently integrate Europe's defense industrial resources, and establish a joint command system, it could still play a more pivotal leadership role in advancing European defense autonomy.

Lai Ching-te's regression on cross-Strait exchanges doomed to fail
However intense the DPP-imposed restrictions are, they can not block the genuine goodwill and close ties between people on both sides of the Strait. Lai's desperate attempts to shut the doors of exchanges and cooperation are doomed to a shameful failure.

More than a rearming policy, EU needs an independent foreign policy
Given how the US is shifting its policies toward Europe, reducing dependence on the US and achieving defense autonomy has become a common goal among European nations. However, there are various challenges to Europe's defense autonomy.

Collective misjudgments not collective insights
A main hindrance to repairing the Sino-US relations is that some in Washington stubbornly regard China as US' archrival. The latest evidence is the release of this year's annual US intelligence report on Tuesday, which claims that "China presents the most comprehensive and robust military threat to US national security".

Hegseth will recognize US' limits in its bid to contain China via regional division
Having already visited Europe, where he openly declared the United States' attention was focused on the Asia-Pacific and underscored Washington's singular fixation on China as a strategic competitor, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has embarked on a visit to Hawaii, Guam, the Philippines and Japan.

DPP authorities will be held accountable for each and every secessionist move

Philippines' self-perception of 'strategic importance' reveals unrealistic miscalculation
If Manila fails to recognize the unequal nature of this relationship, excessively relying on US support, which is fraught with uncertainty, and even adopting a more aggressive stance on the South China Sea dispute, it will only place itself in a more dangerous situation. The pursuit of a modernized military may develop into a colonial tendency.

Global efforts to ban anti-personnel landmines face geopolitical headwinds
The withdrawal of these five countries reflects the geopolitical backlash against the international community's humanitarian efforts to ban anti-personnel landmines. The clash between national security claims and humanitarian concerns highlights the deep-rooted contradictions in contemporary international security governance.

Dramatic breakthrough out of reach
The international community must work together to create conditions conducive to direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations, free from external coercion or geopolitical manipulation. Only through inclusive and equitable diplomacy can this devastating conflict be brought to a just and enduring end.

Israel's operations in Gaza must cease
History has shown that violence is not the answer to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Only through mutual respect, adherence to international law, and a commitment to peaceful coexistence can just and lasting peace be achieved. Israel must stop its military operations in Gaza. The international community must act decisively and step up its efforts to bring an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people.

Nuclear sharing: Shield or Illusion?
Looking back at history, whether it was Georgia in 2008, or now Ukraine and Europe, they have all become sacrifices for the US to pursue its own interests. Can the US promises of nuclear sharing and nuclear protection be trusted by Europe? Can other US security guarantees be trusted? And in the future, can US allies trust the US? These questions certainly raise significant doubts.
